            I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people
            who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
            course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
            life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched
            careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

            ><br />“ Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of
            code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
            learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
            former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
            were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
            have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
            example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
            job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
            recommend! ”
